# DataEng: ETL marketing campaing

ETL process from a marketing campaign dataset extracted from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodsaldanha/arketing-campaign)

I stored this dataset in Google cloud Platform, pulled it to my colab notebook, made the ETL process using pandas and pyspark then pushed this treated file back to GCP.
What if I wanted to use MongoDB instead of GCP? I also made a mongo connection and did the same thing I've done with GCP.
